    "Ans 1 - The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system using the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. By achieving these goals, OOP helps developers build more maintainable, extensible, and understandable software systems that mirror real-world relationships and interactions. "
