    "\n",
    "Logging provides several benefits in software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Debugging and Issue Resolution: By incorporating logging statements throughout the code, developers can log relevant information, such as variable values, function calls, or error messages. This helps in identifying and resolving issues, especially in complex systems where it's not always possible to use a debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Error Tracking and Analysis: Logging allows developers to record error messages and provides valuable information for troubleshooting and bug fixing.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Monitoring and Performance Analysis: Logging can be used to track the performance of an application, record execution times or log specific events. These vhlogs can be analyzed later to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize code, and make informed decisions to improve overall system efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Audit Trails and Compliance: In certain industries or applications, maintaining an audit trail is crucial for security, compliance, or legal reasons. Logging can be used to record user actions, system events, or other relevant information for auditing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "v) Long-term Analysis and Historical Data: Logs can be stored and analyzed over time to gain insights into system behavior, patterns, or trends. They can be useful for capacity planning, identifying usage patterns, or detecting anomalies."

    "\n",
    "WARNING: This level indicates potential issues or situations that may cause problems but are not critical. It is used to alert developers or administrators about non-fatal issues that may require attention. Example usage: Logging a deprecated feature usage or an unusual but recoverable condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "ERROR: This level represents errors that caused the program to fail or behave unexpectedly. It indicates more severe issues that prevent the program from continuing its execution. Example usage: Logging an exception that was caught and handled, but resulted in an abnormal program flow.\n",

    "CRITICAL: This level is used to log critical errors or failures that require immediate attention.

    "1) Purpose & Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: The logging module is designed specifically for generating log messages. It provides a flexible and structured way to record information about the execution of a program. Log messages are typically stored in files, displayed in the console, or sent to other logging handlers for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print Statements: The print statement is primarily used for simple output to the console. It displays messages directly to the standard output, which is typically the console or terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Flexibility & Control:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: The logging module offers more flexibility and control over log messages. It allows you to define log levels, format log messages, set up multiple loggers, configure different handlers, and filter log output based on various criteria. Logging provides a structured way to categorize and control the level of detail in log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print Statements: Print statements are less flexible compared to logging. They provide a straightforward way to display values or messages, but they lack the control and configuration options available in the logging module.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Debugging & maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging: Logging is particularly useful for debugging and maintenance. It allows you to record detailed information, variable values, stack traces, and other relevant data during program execution. Log messages can be selectively enabled or disabled, making it easier to debug and diagnose issues. Additionally, log files provide a historical record of application behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print Statements: Print statements can be helpful for simple debugging or quick checks during development. However, they are less suitable for production code or complex debugging scenarios since they lack the fine-grained control and configurability of logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "********************************************************************************************************************************\n",
    "\n",
    "We should use logging over print statements in a real-world application because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: Logging provides a standardized way to document and monitor the behavior of your application. Log messages can be easily searched, filtered, and analyzed for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity and Flexibility: Logging allows you to set different log levels, enabling you to control the level of detail in log output based on the environment (e.g., development, testing, production). It offers more configuration options and supports various logging handlers and formatters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Environment: Print statements are often used during development for quick feedback or debugging. However, in a production environment, excessive print statements can clutter the console output and impact performance. Logging allows you to selectively enable or disable log levels, making it suitable for long-term production usage.\n",
